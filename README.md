# Maps-Application

I designed a application which asks the information of user and the profile picture either by taking a pic or by choosing from the gallery. User can manually enter the address or use the get address button to get the address. This was done using Geocoding API. After logging in the page redirects to the home page where the user location is shown on the map which has the profile pic of the user as the marker. here's the wiki page link: https://github.com/SaiMohith/Maps-Application/wiki/Home-Application
